	      <div class="characterPartText hideable">Kaer Morhen (corruption of Elder Speech: Caer a'Muirehen, <br>
	  meaning Keep of the Elder Sea) is an old keep<br>
	   where witchers of the School of the Wolf used to be trained. <br>
	  It is located in the Blue Mountains of Hertch in the kingdom of Kaedwen, <br>
	  right off the Gwenllech river. The castle can only be reached by "The Witchers Trail", <br>
	  nicknamed "The Killer", which is easy to miss and encircles the keep. <br>
	   While Trials and Changes are no longer performed here, witchers still tend to rest here <br>
	  between their assignments—usually during the winter, <br>
	  after which they set out on The Path again.</div>

	   in the 13th century and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. <br>
	  Like many of the other witchers, <br>
	  he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.<br><br>
	  He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. <br>
	  By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; <br>
	  however, as he was only a fencing instructor, <br>
	  he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create <br>
	  new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.<br></div>
